# Currency Conversion

Write a program that converts currency.

Use this formula:
$$amount_{to} = \frac{amount_{from} \times rate_{from}}{rate_{to}}$$

**EXAMPLE:**

```
How many Euros are you exchanging? 81
What is the exchange rate? 137.51
81 euros at an exchange rate of 137.51 is 111.38 US dollars
```
