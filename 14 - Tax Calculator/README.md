# Tax Calculator

Write a simple program to compute the tax on an order amount. The program should prompt for the order amount and the state. 
If the state is "WI," then the order must be charged 5.5% tax, else none.

**EXAMPLE:**

```
What is the order amount? 10
What is the state? WI
The subtotal is $10.00.
The tax is $0.55.
The total is $10.55.
```
