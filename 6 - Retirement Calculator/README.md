# Retirement Calculator

Create a program that takes your age, the age at which you wish to retire, shows how many years you have left until you can retire, and and in what year that will be.

**EXAMPLE:**

```
How old are you? 25
At what age would like to retire? 65
You have 40 years left until you can retire.
It's 2015, so you can retire in 2055
```
