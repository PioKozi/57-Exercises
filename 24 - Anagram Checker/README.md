# Anagram Checker

Create a program that compares two strings and determines if the two strings are
anagrams. The program should prompt for both input strings and display the
output as shown in the example.

**EXAMPLE:**

```plaintext
Enter two strings and I'll tell you if they are anagrams:
Enter the first string: note
Enter the second string: tone
"note" and "tone" are anagrams.
```
