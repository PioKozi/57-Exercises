# Computing Simple Interest

Create a program to compute simple interest. Prompt for the principal amount, the rate as a percentage, and time, and display the final total.

The formula to use is $A = P(1 + rt)$ where $P$ is the principal amount, $r$ is the annual amount of interest, and $t$ is the number of years the amount is invested.

**EXAMPLE:**

```
Enter the principal: 1500
Enter the rate of interest: 4.3
Enter the number of years: 4
After 4 years at 4.3%, the investment will be worth Â£1758.
