# Paint Calculator

Create a program to prompt for the width and length of a room, and state how many gallons of paint are required to paint that area. The amount of paint must be a whole number - rounded up.  
Assume 1 gallon covers 350 square feet.  


**EXAMPLE:**
```
What is w? 
What is l? 
You will require [gal] gallons of paint to cover [w * l] square feet.
