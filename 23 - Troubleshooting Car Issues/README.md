# Troubleshooting Car Issues

Create a program that walks the user through troubleshooting issues with a car.
[Decision tree used to build the system is described in the book.]

You must ask only questions that are relevant to the situation and to the
previous answers. Don't ask for all inputs at once.

**EXAMPLE:**

```plaintext
Is the car silent when you turn the key? y
Are the battery terminals corroded? n
Replace the cables and try again.
```
