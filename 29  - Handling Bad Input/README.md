# Handling Bad Input

Write a quick calculator that prompts for the rate or return on an investment
and calculates how many years it will take to double your investment.

The formula is

$$ years = 72 / r $$

Where $r$ is the expected rate of return

If the input $r$ is not numerical, or is $0$, do not allow, and repeat.
