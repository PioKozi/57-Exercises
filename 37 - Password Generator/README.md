# Password Generator

Create a program that generates a secure password. Prompt the user for
the minimum length, the number of special characters, and the number of
numbers. Then generate a password for the user using those inputs.

**EXAMPLE:**

``` plaintext
What's the minimum length? 8
How many special chacaters? 2
How many numbers? 2
Your password is
aurn2$1s#
```

Note: I personally wouldn't trust this for making good, strong
passwords. For reference, please see [this xkcd](https://xkcd.com/936/)
