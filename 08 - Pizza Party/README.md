# Pizza Party

Write a program to evenly divide pizzas, prompting for the number of people, pizzas, and slices per pizza. Ensure the number of pieces comes out even. Display the number of slices each person should get, and how many leftover pieces there are.

**EXAMPLE:**

```
How many people? 8
How many pizzas? 2
How many slices per pizza? 8

8 people with 2 pizzas, each 8 slices
Each person gets 2 slices of pizza.
There are 0 leftover pieces.
