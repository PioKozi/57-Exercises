# Picking a Winner

Create a program that picks a winner from a list random. Prompt for names of
contestants until the user leaves an entry blank. Then randomly select a winner.

**EXAMPLE:**

```plaintext
Enter a name: Alice
Enter a name: Bob
Enter a name: Charlie
Enter a name: Dave
Enter a name: Eve
Enter a name:
The winner is... Dave
```
