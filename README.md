# 57 Exercises

I will be going through the book ["Exercises for Programmers," by Brian P. Hogan](https://pragprog.com/book/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers),
 which seems pretty good for learning languages or practising them.

Often, however, I will ignore certain constraints to the challenges, paying more
 attention to the challenge description above.

Anyway, if you can tell me how to improve my solutions, please do, as it would
 help me learn the languages better :smile:
