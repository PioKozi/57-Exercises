# 57 Exercises

I will be going through the book ["Exercises for Programmers," by Brian P. Hogan](https://pragprog.com/book/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers), which I do recommend for practicing programming.  

The constraints put into the tasks may not always be met perfectly, and the book also contains challenges that may not necessarily be met or even posted in the relevant task's README. This is as to some of the languages I am quite new, and this exercise's purpose for that would be simply to help learn the language.  

Anyway, if you can tell me how to improve my solutions, please do, as it would help me learn the languages better :smile:
