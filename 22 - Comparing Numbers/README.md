# Comparing Numbers

Write a program that asks for 3 numbers. Check first to see if they're all
different - if not, exit. Otherwise, display the largest number of the 3.

Write the algorithm manually. Don't use a built-in function for finding the
largest number in a list.

**EXAMPLE:**

```plaintext
Enter the first number: 1
Enter the second number: 51
Enter the third number: 2
The largest number is 51.
```
